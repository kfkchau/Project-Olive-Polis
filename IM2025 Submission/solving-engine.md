## 🧠 Gav Sub-Framework – Problem Solving Logic

**Audience**: Policy professionals, delivery teams, executive advisors, governance reviewers  
**Purpose**: To explain how Gav frames problems, defines requirements, proposes solutions, and constructs deliverables—using a structured, traceable logic chain that mirrors how high-performing organisations think.

### 1. 🎯 Purpose

This module defines Gav’s **Problem → Requirement → Solution → Deliverable** logic. It is not a software feature. It is a reasoning discipline.

Gav doesn’t jump to answers. It builds them—step by step, with traceability.

This logic is designed to mimic **business logic**:  
- What’s the problem?  
- What must be done?  
- What will fix it?  
- What will we produce?

It is not academic logic (which is governed by **disciplinary input**)  
It is not government logic (which is governed by **government context**)  
It is **business logic**—the logic of delivery, accountability, and value.

### 2. 🧩 Core Structure

| Layer | Covers From → To | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **Problem** | From identifying a gap, risk, or opportunity → to clearly framing the issue | What needs to be addressed? |
| **Requirement** | From understanding the problem → to defining what must be done or produced | What must be included, how it should be structured, and what tone or format it must follow |
| **Solution** | From defined requirements → to proposing a fix or action | What will resolve the problem? |
| **Deliverable** | From solution logic → to constructing a product that communicates or enables it | What will be produced, shared, or submitted? |

Each layer is tagged, versioned, and traceable. Gav shows its work.

### 3. 🧠 Design Rationale

#### 🔹 Why this is business logic

Because it reflects how real-world delivery teams operate.  
In business, the logic is simple:  
- Identify the problem  
- Define what success looks like  
- Propose a fix  
- Build something that works

This logic is **goal-oriented**, **outcome-driven**, and **accountability-focused**.  
It doesn’t wait for perfect theory. It moves from insight to action.

#### 🔹 How it works with government logic

Government logic is layered with mandates, lifecycle stages, and institutional anchors.  
That’s why Gav uses **government context** to tag the task’s position in the governance lifecycle.  
This ensures the business logic is applied in a way that respects public sector structure, scope, and authority.

#### 🔹 How it works with academic logic

Academic logic is grounded in disciplinary rigour, evidence, and synthesis.  
That’s why Gav uses **disciplinary input** to bring in SME advice and domain-specific reasoning.  
This ensures the business logic is not shallow—it’s informed, tested, and explainable.

### 4. 🧾 Requirement Logic – Inclusion, Structure, Style

Gav defines requirements using three dimensions:

| Dimension | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Inclusion** | What must be included, excluded, or declared | “Must include fiscal impact, exclude draft policy options, declare data source” |
| **Structure** | How the content must be ordered, formatted, or sequenced | “Use 3-part structure: context → analysis → recommendation” |
| **Style** | Tone, formatting, and language variant | “Use plain English, active voice, Australian Government Style Manual” |

These requirements are derived from:
- User input (e.g. “make it short”, “use Cabinet format”)  
- Disciplinary input (e.g. legal tone, economic framing)  
- Government context (e.g. lifecycle stage, audience scope)

---

### 5. 🧾 Examples

| Scenario | Problem | Requirement | Solution | Deliverable |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Service delays in regional areas | Long wait times for digital ID verification | Must include regional data, service benchmarks, and escalation options | Introduce a regional fast-track protocol | Briefing note for drpartment executive |
| New legislation passed | Need to update internal compliance processes | Must include legal references, affected teams, and implementation timeline | Update SOPs and training modules | Internal compliance pack |
| Minister requests update | Need to summarise program performance | Must include KPIs, risks, and next steps | Draft a 2-page summary with visual dashboard | Ministerial briefing |

---

### 6. 🧭 What This Enables

- **Traceability** – Every output is linked to a problem, requirement, and solution  
- **Auditability** – Every change is versioned and tagged  
- **Clarity** – Every deliverable has a purpose, logic, and structure  
- **Governance** – Every reasoning step is visible and explainable

---

### 7. 🔗 Integration Points

- **Government Context** – Governance Lifecycle tags shape how problems are framed  
- **Disciplinary Input** – Disciplines influence how requirements are defined  
- **Deliverable Display** – Solutions are linked to structured outputs  
- **Interaction** – Clarifying questions are triggered when logic is missing or unclear

### 8. 🧠 Summary

Gav doesn’t just answer questions. It builds answers.  
It doesn’t just write documents. It shows why they exist.  
It doesn’t just use AI. It governs it.

If you want better outputs, start with better problems.  
If you want better decisions, define better requirements.  
If you want better governance, structure your logic.

That’s what Gav does.
