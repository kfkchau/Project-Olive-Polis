# ðŸ§  Gav the Gov Reasoner â€“ IM2025

Gav was built as a proof of concept for the open-source framework **Project Olive Polis** and submitted as an official entry to Australiaâ€™s Public Sector Innovation Month 2025. It demonstrates a new model of humanâ€“machine teaming for structured reasoning, governance-aligned output generation, and cognitive collaboration.

## ðŸ“˜ What Is Gav?

Gav is a modular reasoning system hosted on the ChatGPT Custom GPT platform:

It is powered by a backend architecture derived from **Project Olive Polis**:

Gav was co-developed through structured dialogue with a reasoning bot acting as co-founder and independent thinking partner. It scaffolds logic, maps requirements, and co-builds structured outputsâ€”briefs, submissions, speechesâ€”using a governance-first model and a seven-section output format.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

Gavâ€™s architecture is composed of 13 interlinked modules, each governing a distinct layer of logic:

- **Context Module** â€“ Anchors lifecycle stage, institutional logic, and governance scope  
- **Disciplinary Module** â€“ Selects relevant lenses and synthesises SME input  
- **Execution Module** â€“ Frames problems, maps requirements, and proposes solutions  
- **Deliverable Module** â€“ Constructs structured outputs with versioning and traceability  
- **Output Module** â€“ Enforces a seven-section display format for all outputs  
- **Interaction Module** â€“ Generates clarifying questions, flags contradictions, and suggests next steps  
- **Response Module** â€“ Provides strategic commentary and explanation logic  
- **Governance Module** â€“ Validates compliance, audit trail, and structural integrity  
- **Knowledge Module** â€“ Manages live updates and change logs  
- **Thinking Module** â€“ Applies reasoning principles and fallback logic  
- **Workflow Module** â€“ Sequences cognitive phases and engine activation  
- **Reference Module** â€“ Enforces terminology and tagging consistency  
- **Technical Module** â€“ Governs backend logic (non-display)

Each module is interoperable, traceable, and governed by a unified reasoning protocol.

## ðŸ§  Output Structure

All outputs follow a seven-section format:

1. **Response** â€“ Strategic commentary and reasoning summary  
2. **Government Context** â€“ Governance lifecycle, institutional anchors, organisational anchors, scope  
3. **Disciplinary Input** â€“ Selected lenses, SME input, synthesis rationale  
4. **Problem Solving** â€“ Structured execution logic with traceability  
5. **Deliverable Display** â€“ Drafts, status, versioning, requirement mapping  
6. **Interaction** â€“ Clarifying questions, flags, suggested next steps  
7. **Session Governance** â€“ Final compliance check and audit trail

## ðŸ§¾ Governance Compliance

Gav enforces governance-first principles including:

- **Explainability** â€“ All reasoning steps are shown  
- **Transparency** â€“ All logic is traceable and versioned  
- **Auditability** â€“ Every change is logged  
- **Accountability** â€“ Outputs are aligned with APS Code of Conduct and AI Ethics Principles

## ðŸ§  Thinking Principles

Gav applies structured clarity, merit-based judgement, independent reasoning, and source transparency. No reasoning is hidden. No logic is untagged. Every output is built from defensible logic chains and live knowledge updates.
