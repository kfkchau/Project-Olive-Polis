## ðŸ§  Gav Sub-Framework â€“ Disciplinary Input Logic

**Audience**: Policy professionals, governance reviewers, subject matter experts, public sector teams  
**Purpose**: To explain how Gav selects, synthesises, and applies disciplinary lenses to interpret governance tasksâ€”ensuring that outputs are grounded in domain logic, not just generic AI reasoning.

### 1. ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This module defines Gavâ€™s **Disciplinary Input** logic. It is not about academic theory. It is about applying the right lens to the right task.

Gav doesnâ€™t just generate content. It interprets tasks using structured domain logicâ€”legal, economic, policy, operational, digital, and more.

Disciplinary input is how Gav mimics **academic logic**:  
- What lens should be applied?  
- What does the expert view say?  
- How do we synthesise multiple perspectives?

This logic complements **business logic** (Problem â†’ Requirement â†’ Solution â†’ Deliverable)  
It is guided by **government logic** (via lifecycle tagging in `gov_context`)  
But it is powered by **disciplinary logic**â€”the logic of expertise, evidence, and structured interpretation.

### 2. ðŸ§© Core Structure

| Layer | Covers From â†’ To | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **Discipline Selection** | From context and user input â†’ to identifying relevant lenses | What domains are relevant to this task? |
| **SME Input** | From selected lenses â†’ to generating plain-language advice | What would a subject matter expert say? |
| **Synthesis Rationale** | From multiple SME views â†’ to structured reasoning | How do we combine, prioritise, or resolve competing views? |
| **Impact Mapping** | From disciplinary logic â†’ to requirement and deliverables | How does this affect what must be included, how itâ€™s structured, and how itâ€™s styled? |

### 3. ðŸ§  Design Rationale

#### ðŸ”¹ Why this is academic logic

Because it reflects how experts think.  
In academic reasoning, the logic is:  
- Select the right lens  
- Interpret the issue using domain knowledge  
- Synthesise multiple views  
- Show your reasoning

Gav applies this logic to governance tasksâ€”not to theorise, but to clarify.

#### ðŸ”¹ Why this matters for governance

Because public sector work is interdisciplinary.  
A policy issue may require legal interpretation, economic modelling, and operational feasibility.  
Gav doesnâ€™t flatten these. It tags them, synthesises them, and shows how they shape the output.

#### ðŸ”¹ Why this complements business logic

Business logic defines the structure: problem â†’ requirement â†’ solution â†’ deliverable  
Disciplinary input defines the depth: what must be included, how it must be reasoned, and what tone it must carry.

Together, they ensure that outputs are both **structured** and **grounded**.

### 4. ðŸ§¾ Examples

| Scenario | Disciplines | SME Input | Synthesis Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Drafting a Cabinet submission on digital identity | Legal, Policy, Communications | Legal: cite Privacy Act; Policy: align with mandate; Comms: use plain English | Prioritise legal compliance, frame policy logic, simplify for readability |
| Designing a service reform | Operational, Economic, Governance | Ops: feasibility; Econ: cost modelling; Gov: compliance | Balance feasibility with impact, ensure auditability |
| Responding to a data breach | Legal, Digital, Communications | Legal: breach notification; Digital: system patching; Comms: stakeholder messaging | Legal obligations first, technical fix second, messaging third |

### 5. ðŸ§­ What This Enables

- **Interpretability** â€“ Outputs are grounded in domain logic  
- **Transparency** â€“ SME views are shown, not hidden  
- **Synthesis** â€“ Conflicting views are resolved with rationale  
- **Governance** â€“ Reasoning is traceable to disciplines, not just AI inference

---

### 6. ðŸ”— Integration Points

- **Government Context** â€“ Lifecycle and scope tags guide discipline selection  
- **Problem Solving** â€“ Disciplines shape requirement logic  
- **Deliverable Display** â€“ SME input and synthesis rationale are shown  
- **Interaction** â€“ Flags and clarifying questions are triggered when disciplinary gaps exist

### 7. ðŸ§  Summary

Gav doesnâ€™t just write. It reasons.  
It doesnâ€™t just generate. It interprets.  
It doesnâ€™t just use AI. It applies expertise.

If you want clarity, use the right lens.  
If you want structure, define the logic.  
If you want governance, show your reasoning.

Thatâ€™s what Gav does.
